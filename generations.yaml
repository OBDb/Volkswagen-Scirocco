generations:
  - name: "First Generation (Type 53)"
    start_year: 1974
    end_year: 1981
    description: "The first-generation Volkswagen Scirocco was introduced as a sport compact coupe based on the Golf platform, designed to offer more exciting styling and driving dynamics than its practical hatchback sibling. Styled by Giorgetto Giugiaro with sharp, angular lines, a low-slung profile, and a distinctive fastback silhouette, the original Scirocco established a template for affordable sport coupes that balanced performance with practicality. Powered by a range of four-cylinder engines including 1.1, 1.3, 1.5, 1.6, and 1.7-liter units with power outputs ranging from 50 to 110 horsepower depending on market and model year, paired with four or five-speed manual transmissions driving the front wheels, the Scirocco offered lively if not outright powerful performance. The chassis featured sport-tuned suspension with MacPherson struts up front and trailing arms at the rear, delivering responsive handling that made the most of the available power. Despite its sporty character, the interior maintained reasonable practicality with 2+2 seating, a rear hatch providing access to the cargo area, and folding rear seats allowing for expanded storage capacity. Notable variants included the more powerful GLI and GTI models with fuel-injected engines offering enhanced performance, particularly in later model years. The first-generation Scirocco successfully created a more emotional, performance-oriented option within Volkswagen's expanding front-wheel drive lineup, appealing to younger buyers and driving enthusiasts while maintaining reasonable affordability and the fundamental reliability that defined the brand's products of this era."

  - name: "Second Generation (Type 53B)"
    start_year: 1981
    end_year: 1992
    description: "The second-generation Volkswagen Scirocco featured more angular, wedge-shaped styling with a higher beltline, larger glass areas, and an overall more substantial presence than its predecessor, though maintaining the same fundamental sports coupe concept. Continuing to share its platform and mechanical components with the Golf, the Mk2 Scirocco offered enhanced performance, refinement, and features while maintaining its position as the more emotional, design-focused alternative to Volkswagen's practical hatchbacks. Engine options varied by market but typically included a range of four-cylinder units from 1.3 to 1.8 liters, with the most powerful variants featuring 16-valve technology and producing up to 139 horsepower in the Scirocco 16V, paired with manual or automatic transmissions. The chassis featured revised suspension tuning for improved handling and ride quality, while maintaining the responsive, engaging driving characteristics that had defined the original model. Despite its sportier positioning, the interior maintained good practicality for a coupe, with reasonable rear seat space, a useful cargo area accessed via the rear hatch, and folding rear seats allowing for expanded storage capacity. Notable variants included the limited-production Wolfsburg Edition in North America and various market-specific special editions throughout the production run. While the second-generation Scirocco continued the successful formula established by its predecessor, it eventually faced increasing internal competition from the Golf GTI, which offered similar performance with greater practicality at a comparable price. Production ended in 1992 without an immediate successor, as Volkswagen shifted its sports coupe focus to the Corrado that had been introduced in 1988 as a more upmarket model, leaving the Scirocco nameplate dormant for over 15 years before its eventual revival."

  - name: "Third Generation (Type 13)"
    start_year: 2008
    end_year: 2017
    description: "The third-generation Volkswagen Scirocco, revived after a 16-year hiatus, reimagined the sports coupe concept for a new era while maintaining the fundamental approach of offering a more emotional, design-focused alternative to the Golf. Featuring dramatic styling with a low, wide stance, muscular wheel arches, a swept-back roofline, and distinctive details including a large roof spoiler and wide-set rear lights, the new Scirocco created a much more aggressive, distinctive appearance than its predecessors. Built on the PQ35 platform shared with the contemporary Golf, the third-generation Scirocco was offered exclusively as a three-door, four-seat hatchback coupe. Engine options varied by market but typically included a range of TSI petrol and TDI diesel units with power outputs ranging from approximately 120 to 280 horsepower in the range-topping Scirocco R, paired with manual or DSG dual-clutch automatic transmissions. The chassis featured sport-tuned suspension, available adaptive dampers (Dynamic Chassis Control), and advanced electronics including XDS electronic differential lock on higher-powered variants, delivering engaging handling that maintained the model's tradition of balancing performance with everyday usability. Despite its coupe styling, the interior offered reasonable practicality with adequate rear seat space for shorter journeys and a useful cargo area, though with compromised rear headroom and visibility compared to more conventional hatchbacks. A significant refresh in 2014 brought revised styling, enhanced technology, and improved efficiency across the range. The third-generation Scirocco successfully reinterpreted the nameplate for contemporary buyers, offering distinctive styling and engaging driving dynamics in a practical package, though its availability was limited in some marketsâ€”notably never officially imported to North America despite the model's historical popularity in that region. Production ended in 2017 without a direct successor, reflecting both changing market preferences toward crossovers and internal competition from the increasingly capable Golf GTI and R models."
